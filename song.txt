Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Hit the house lick, tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (tell my bros, tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on, "Let Burn" came on)
